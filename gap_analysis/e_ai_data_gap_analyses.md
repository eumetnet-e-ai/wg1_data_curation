## Summary
This Data Gap Analysis for Weather and Climate-Related AI/ML Applications is part of the EUMETNET Artificial Intelligence (E-AI) Working Group 1 ('Data Curation') activities. Its primary goal is to identify key data requirements, gaps, and obstacles hindering the effective use of weather and climate data for AI/ML-based applications. 

Key data gaps include missing datasets such as cloud fraction data from high-resolution LEO satellites for Northern Europe and comprehensive icing observations in gridded formats. Additionally, long training datasets for MTG FCI and LI data as well as European-wide weather radar products like echo tops and hail detection remain unavailable.

Obstacles to data usage include slow download speeds, exotic and inconsistent data formats and time steps, lacking or complex geo-referencing, licensing restrictions, and incomplete temporal/geospatial coverage. The lack of real-time equivalents to Climate Data Records (CDRs) further limits AI/ML training capabilities.

Future avenues of this work include expanding the data inventory, providing usage examples, and curating best practices to make weather and climate data more AI-ready. Contributions and feedback from the community are encouraged to further refine this living document and support advancements in AI/ML applications for weather and climate science.

### Reanalyses

Reanalyses are a key dataset for early ML, since they provide a gridded physically consistent dataset that has no spatial (neither in the vertical nor in the horizontal) or temporal gap.

The available products can be divided between global and regional reanalyses, based on their spatial coverage.

#### Global Reanalyses
The current available global reanalyses are summarized below.

| ICON-DREAM |  ? | ? |  CC-BY4.0 | 13km  | ? | 2010 onwards | 1 hour | ? |

ICON-DREAM is included in the available reanalyses even if the data sharing and paper publication is still ongoing.

The planned global reanalyses are summarized below.

| Data Type |  Planned production start | License | Resolution | Format | Time Range | Time Step | Challenges |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|------------|
| ERA6 |   Q2 2026 | [Licence](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/copernicus/) | 14km () |  | 1940 onwards | 1 hour | ? |
| MERRA-21C |  2027/2028 | - | -  | - | - | - | - |
| ICON-DREAM |  2026 | - | 13km  |  | 1980 onwards | 1 hour | ? |

While the planned ERA6 and MERRA-21C include an update of the whole system, the ICON-DREAM is only a back-extension and no major updates are planned.
MERRA-21C has no planned start, as the system is currently being tested, including the possibility of adding an ensemble to it.

A major challenge for the current global reanalyses is the impossibility to assess uncertainty as only ERA5 provides an ensemble, prior to ICON-DREAM.
Furthermore, the ERA5 ensemble is only meant to sample the observations uncertainties, as it perturbs the observational error.

ICON-DREAM provides a 20-ensemble members (ERA5/ERA6 10), which includes physical perturbations and parameter perturbations. However, the challenge lies in sharing this data volume.

#### European and other Regional Reanalyses

One of the main limitations for the regional reanalyses production is that they rely on the global reanalyses to provide the boundary conditions.
Therefore, the current system currently used in the numerical weather forecast needs to be adapted for a reduced/lack of ensemble.

The ICON-DREAM reanalyses is the 2-way nest over Europe of the global reanalyses previously described.

The challenge with our regional reanalyses is that:
1. very few are continued, i.e. CERRA, ICON-DREAM
2. their uncertainty is hard to estimate, i.e. CERRA has ERA5 ensemble.
3. ICON-DREAM is looking for a sharing strategy.

One of the main scientific challenges for regional reanalyses is to provide a climate-consistent representation that is not influenced by the inclusion of observations throughout the period.
Therefore, the Japan Meteorological Agency has suggested a framework for regional reanalyses that split what was one product into two: sparse-input and full-input.
The sparse/full- input they refer to the observations, the first is with a very limited subset of available observation types for which there is a long record.
The full-input refers to using as many observations as the current operational system, but limiting the period to one that includes all observation types.

The planned regional reanalyses for Europe and other regions are summarized below.

| Data Type |  Planned production start | License | Resolution | Format | Time Range | Time Step | Challenges |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|------------|
| ARRA |   Q4 2024 |  | 1.3km  |  | 1961-2020  | 1 hour? | Data sharing: ~13 PB |
| ICON-FORCE |  2026 | - | 2.1km  |  | 2016 onwards | 1 hour/sub-hourly | ? |
| ICON-FORCE-C |  2026 | - | 2.1km  |  | 2016 onwards | 1 hour/sub-hourly | ? |
| CaSR 4  |  2028 | - | ?  |  | 1980 onwards | 1 hour/sub-hourly | ? |

The main challenge that regional reanalyses are facing is the high volume of data and the lack of a common sharing platform, as at the moment each producer has to create that as well.

#### Reanalysis challenges
The reanalysis production faces two main challenges: the observation processing and the sharing of the final product.

We go now more in detail about both.

##### Observations for producing the reanalysis

A major technical challenge for producing reanalysis is finding and/or getting access to observations for the past times that not only have a good quality, but also are readable by modern systems.

The centers producing the reanalysis in fact uses their own conventional observations (i.e. SYNOP, TEMP, SHIP, DRIBU,PILOT,AIREP), and those are locally stored.
Further issues are related to the format of the data: 
1. centers might not store them in a WMO-standard format, making data sharing very complex; 
2. changes in the WMO-formats in the decades, forward compatibility to modern formats is not always ensure and trivial. 

When thinking about multi-decades reanalysis, it is important to remember that the local availability depends also not only on the center's history itsefl, but also on the country history.
   
Regarding the satellites observations, centers like EUMETSAT, UCAR, etc, provide reprocessed observational datasets. 
These products have the benefits of having a modern format, but has in mind different end-users.
This makes very complicate to use such datasets out of the box, given how different in structure and information stored are with respect to the operational version that is sent for weather forecasting.
To use datasets such as [EUMETSAT ASCAT](https://dx.doi.org/10.15770/EUM_SEC_CLM_0041), the data assimilation code has to go under major re-write for the IO, quality checks, etc.
This however, would hinder the reanalysis advances due to the complexity in merging the faster paced R&D ongoing in the numerical weather prediction framework.

##### Sharing of the reanalysis products

The second challenge faced in the reanalysis, but not only there, is to find a plattform to share the large volume of data.
For the reanalysis, it is especially important that any user can easily access/download many model variables, as e.g. they can be used as initial/boundary conditions for other AI/classical-downscaling runs.

The latter is a limitation for the planning and/or creation of future regional reanalysis, as they can only be designed with what is easily available.

### NWP data

While reanalysis data sets have enabled a fast evolution in the development of AI-based forecasting models, latest (physics-based) forecasts at higher resolutions are a valuable data source to tune the modeling of current weather situations and help improve (AI-based) numerical forecasts. Fortunately, an increasingly number of open data sets are now avialble:

| Data Type | Realtime Service | Archive | License | Resolution | Format | Time Range | Challenges |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|---------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| ECMWF - IFS global medium-range - physics based model + ensembles | [Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/access-forecasts/access-real-time-open-data) | [Archive](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/access-forecasts/access-archive-datasets) | [CC-4.0-BY and the ECMWF ToU](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/) | (9km ->) | GRIB/NetCDF | 15 days |  |

### Impact & IoT data

The use of AI opens up the possibility to intergrate a wider range of novel (observational) data on which models can be trained. This includes data on impacts of weather events and data measured by IoT and smart devices.

There have been already a number of projects funded under the European Unions's Horizon 2020 and Europe programmes to collect and use IoT data for improved imapact assesments. While these projects show the great potential of these data sources, they also show the more complex handling of the data, not just because of the variance of formats and vocabularies, but also for legal and ethical considerations. Unfortunately the heterogenous and large variance nature of these data sets makes it hard to summarise them here.

Efforts are needed to harmonise the access of IoT data for our community, for example like the [TRIGGER](https://project-trigger.eu) project which uses ECMWF's polytope data access software to create a harmonise interface to a wide variance of IoT data from non-meteorological domains. 

*QUESTION: Would it be better to list projects here, rather than data sets?*

## Identification of Data Gaps and Obstacles in Usage

Based on the analyses, following data gaps and obstacles in usage have be identified. 

### Missing data

Following missing data were identified: 
- Fog prediction data is well-known challenge
- Cloud fraction data from LEO satellites providing high-enough resolution in Northern Europe are missing 
- Icing observations preferably in gridded format and for multiple levels for Norhern Europe are missing
- Long-enough training dataset for MTG FCI and LI-data 
- Missing weather radar products such as echo tops, VIL, and hail prodcuts covering the whole Europe

Moreover, imapct data such as flood, drought, and windstorm data were not yet analysed but it's clear that they are widely missing or only available as proprietary data.

 ### Obstacles in Usage

Following remarkable obastacles in usage were identified:

- Slow download and need to uncompress data after downloading (i.e. for satellite data)
- Exotic and varying data formats
- License restrictions i.e. for some satellite data
- Varying and inconcistent time steps and resolutions. All data is not geo-referenced
- Climate Data Records (CDRs) are great source for training but there's no always corresponding real-time data available
- Limited coverage of data sources / fragmented data sources
- Missing mechanism to share large data volumes (i.e. reanalyses)

## Future avenues

As noted, the current version is done in very limited time and collecting use cases and data sources is still ongoing. More data presumably provides more insight to the data gaps and obstacles in usage.

Moreover, the future avenues for this work may also include extension of the content, including:

- Usage examples (e.g. Jupyter notebooks) 
- List and analyses of tools to handle and convert data to AI-ready form
- Best practices ('do/donts') for the different data types and sources, collected both from data providers and consumers
- Quality analyses of the data sources

**We thank all contributors for their instrumental input and feedback!**

We are looking forward to see more contributions from both data providers and consumers. 
We are also very happy to see hear your feedback and ideas for the future avenues of this work.
